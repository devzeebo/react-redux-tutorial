What is React and Why Should I Care?
	PPT

JSX
	Switching to HTML
		Any Tag; React.Fragment
	Escaping to JS
		{}
	CSS	
		styles, className
	Dynamically choosing a tag
		const in render
	Spread parameters
		<Card ...otherProps>
	Ignored Values
		null, undefined, false, NOT 0
	Custom components must be PascalCase
		

Functional Components
	Immutable props
		Don't change props! It'll break!
		

Class Components
	Immutable state
		Don't change state directly, call setState
	setState
	Asynchronous state
		SetState is async, so don't rely on this.state OR this.props being updated
		use setState((prevState, props) => ({}))		
	Arrays/Objects
		Never mutate state - always modify (concat, Object.assign)

Performance
	Functional vs Not - React 16 doesn't matter!
